## Next Steps (Prioritized)

### Immediate (Complete Analytics)
1. Complete Analytics Service remaining docs:
   - deployment.md
   - security.md
   - failure-modes.md

### Short-term (Core Services)
2. Auth Service (authentication is critical)
3. API Gateway (entry point to platform)

### Medium-term (Business Logic)
4. Portfolio Service
5. Simulation Service

## Time Estimates

- Per file expansion: 15-30 minutes
- Remaining Analytics: 1-1.5 hours
- Each complete service: 2-4 hours
- All services complete: 12-15 hours

## Commands for Quick Progress

```bash
# Save current work
./scripts/save-progress.sh

# Check what's left
cat scripts/progress.txt

# View line counts
find docs/services -name "*.md" -exec wc -l {} \; | sort -n

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "docs: progress update"
git push
```

## Quality Targets

For each file to be considered "complete":
- [ ] Minimum 200 lines
- [ ] Multiple sections with clear headings
- [ ] Code examples and snippets
- [ ] Tables for reference data
- [ ] Real-world usage examples
- [ ] Troubleshooting section
- [ ] Links to related docs

## Notes

- Analytics service can serve as template for other services
- Adapt content depth based on service complexity
- Auth and API Gateway need extra security focus
- Keep consistent formatting across all services
